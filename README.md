I have developed a product inquiry plugin. after install the plugin a (product inquiry) button add before 'add to cart' on single product page. On click of that button a pop appear that takes customer information like name, email, phone no with country codes and show product image, name and id and after submission all the information stores in separate inquiry tab in admin pannel and send email to both admin and customer.
